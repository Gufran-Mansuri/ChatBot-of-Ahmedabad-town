INSTRUCTION: I didn't implemented the discord version of the bot you can load the bot in the
shell easily as soon as you run the file just start the chat() function and you can start asking questions

VECTOR REPRESENTATION: For the intent matching I used the CountVectorizer with the parameters of 
stop words and max_df it was better than other parameters becuause i wanted to reduce the number of 
time words like ahmedabad, places, food which appear in my questions a lot so i put max_df for that and 
stop words helped me to reduce the verbs like is,are,the,and so on such that my vocubalary
was reduced and my vectorizer only focused on the unique and important words I tried to use the other 
parameters as well but it didn't helped that much as in my each questions seems to have some unique words 
thats why using ngram was of no use and even added alot of synonyms of my unique words in my question catalouge
such that even only few words matches the cosine similarity was higher than 0.57

I used setiments.py to determine the tone of the utterance and for the classifier i used the ComplementNB
because it was able to give an accuracy of 83% i tried passing all the different parameters and even tried
to use the Tfidfvectorizer as well but it was of no use either way i was only able to reach a accuracy no more than 83%   

TRANSFER LEARNING: I used the GPT3 transformer api for the question which where not triggered
by the intent matching and then generate the response from the transformer those response will
start with "I am not 100% sure about this but the answer may be:"
